# 🌍 1-Page Project Report: CO₂ Emission Forecasting

## ✅ SDG Addressed:
**SDG 13 – Climate Action**

We address climate change by forecasting future CO₂ emissions to help governments and policymakers make data-driven environmental decisions.

---

## 🧠 ML Approach Used:
**Supervised Learning – Linear Regression**

We trained a regression model using CO₂ emission data for Afghanistan (1949–2020) to predict future emissions. We visualized actual vs. predicted trends.

---

## 📊 Results:
- **MAE**: 1,340,967.07  
- **R² Score**: -1.49  
- The model roughly followed the general emission trend but with some inaccuracies.
- Later-year predictions were more stable.

## 🧭 Ethical Reflection:
- **Bias Risk**: Limited data (one country) may not generalize well.
- **Fairness**: Promotes environmental transparency.
- **Sustainability**: Enables better future planning for emission reductions.
